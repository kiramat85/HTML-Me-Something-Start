        <h2>Why Should Someone Travel to Afghanistan?</h2>
        <p>The country is plagued by war and considered one of the most dangerous countries in the world. Sensible governments advise against all but the most essential of travel in Afghanistan. This part of the world is for those who are curious to learn about its ancient history, spanning thousands of years. People who are curious to see what life in the country was really like. And also for people who are curious to meet the people. The land that is now Afghanistan has a long history of domination by foreign conquerors and strife among internally warring factions. At the gateway between Asia and Europe, this land was conquered by Darius I of Babylonia circa 500 B.C., and Alexander the Great of Macedonia in 329 B.C., among others. Genghis Khan took over the territory in the 13th century, but it wasn’t until the 1700s that the area was united as a single country. By 1870, after the area had been invaded by various Arab conquerors, Islam had taken root.</p>

        <h3>Thousands of Years of History with No One There to See</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Ancient City Of Balkh</li>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>The ancient Balkh, once capital of mighty Bactria, where Zoroastrianism was born and where Timur reigned supreme. Balkh is an ancient city, with a 2500-year long history, situated on the plain between the Hindu Kush Mountains and the river Amu Darya (historically known as the Oxus) in the north of Afghanistan. Known by Arab conquerors as Umm-al-belad, the ‘mother of cities’, Balkh lay on the major Silk Road routes that ran between east and west. The city’s history was illustrious until Genghis Khan and his Mongol hordes wreaked destruction in 1220; Balkh never fully recovered, and eventually faded into a village.</p>

            <p>The city is believed to have been founded between 2000-1500 BC. It is mentioned in Hinduism's sacred Rigveda text (ca. 1700-1100 BC) as a vision of paradise set in the mountains. It was an important center of Zoroastrianism and later Buddhism. The city remained of little importance for much of the first three millennia of its existence. It was controlled variously by: the Persians, Alexander the Great, the Seleucid Empire, the Mauryan Empire, the Bactrians, various Hellenistic kingdoms, the Sassanid Empire, and by the 5th century AD was its own kingdom known as Kabul-Shahan. This last kingdom before the Islamic conquest built a large wall to protect the city from invasion when the Arabs arrived at the edge of the kingdom; parts of the wall have survived to this day and are visible above ground within the city.</p>

        <h1 id="Ghazni">Ghazni</h1>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>Mahmud of Ghazni, an 11th-century conqueror who created an empire from Iran to India, is considered the greatest of Afghanistan’s conquerors. The ancient city of Gazna (modern Ghazni) served as an epicenter for one of the most important empires of the Middle Ages—the Ghaznavids. Holding a strategic position along a major trade route between Khurasan and India, the city was once a thriving Buddhist center in the 7th century. Its citizens put forward fierce resistance to invading Arab armies carrying the new religion of Islam in 683 before eventually being destroyed by Yaqub Saffari in the late 9th century. In the 10th century Turkic mamluks, or "slave soldiers", and their allies rebelled against the ruling Samanid dynastic rulers, taking Ghazna as their central stronghold and later capital. Military campaigns in the region by Mahmud ibn Sabuktagin—known later as Mahmud the Great—further solidified power and firmly established the Ghaznavid Empire that, at its height, stretched from the Caspian Sea to the Ganges Delta. The Ghaznavids were great patrons of the arts and sciences as well as architecture financed from the collected wealth of their military campaigns. The royal court in Ghazni hosted such dynamic and talented personages as the poet Abul-Qasim Firdawsi, the Khwarazmian universal scientist al-Biruni, the Sufi mystic Abu'l Majd Majdud bin Adam (Sana'i al Ghaznavi), and countless other historians, artists, mathematicians, and engineers. Contemporary visitors and residents of the capital city during its height speak of ornate buildings, great libraries, sumptuous court ceremonies, and the wealth of Ghazni's citizens. Unfortunately, today there are few surviving examples of Ghaznavid architecture and monumental artistic form with the only standing examples at Ghazni being the "Towers of Victory".</p>
